# pre-med-forum
The purpose of the Premed101 database is to store the required data to display forums, topics, and posts, generate statistics, generate the leaderboard, and generate member account pages. Through creating a database that will enable the execution of the foregoing functionalities, we will succeed in facilitating the knowledge sharing between pre-medical school students, as well as current medical school students.
